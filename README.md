# CRUD operations in dynamoDB

I'll also be adding a file with questions simulating real life use cases, to help with better understanding of dynamodb operations.

P.S. - I've learnt DynamoDB from Amazon's official guide [here](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/getting-started/). I recommend you learn from here as well.
